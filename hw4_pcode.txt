Begin main (have my argc and argv variables initialized)
Declare and initialize my variables
If argc has one argument, then:
  Take input from the user using stdin
  Once CTRL+D is hit, print out the inputted text using stdout
  Check to make sure no error occured

  Begin a for loop that goes through all entries in argv
    If the current entry is a dash:
      Get input from the user using stdin
      Print out input using stdout
      Check to make sure no errors occured
    Else:
      Attempt to open the file using fopen
      If the file does not exist:
        Tell the user and then move onto the next file
      Else:
        Read in from the file
        Make sure the text was read in correctly using stderr
        Close the file
